            ## PR Review Instructions

            ### Step 1 — Run the review tool
            Execute the following slash command to analyze the pull request:
            /pr-review-toolkit:review-pr ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}

            ### Step 2 — Get the diff with line numbers
            Fetch the PR diff so you know the exact line numbers for changed lines:
            ```
            gh pr diff ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
            ```
            Use the diff output to map each review finding to the precise line number in the file where the change appears.

            ### Step 3 — Post an inline comment for EVERY finding
            For each issue or suggestion identified in Step 1, post a pull request review comment anchored to the exact line number of the change using the GitHub API:
            ```
            curl -X POST \
              -H "Authorization: Bearer ${{ github.token }}" \
              -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
              https://api.github.com/repos/${{ github.repository }}/pulls/${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}/comments \
              -d '{
                "body": "<your comment here>",
                "commit_id": "$(gh pr view ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --json headRefOid --jq .headRefOid)",
                "path": "<file path>",
                "line": <line number>,
                "side": "RIGHT"
              }'
            ```
            - `path` must be the relative file path shown in the diff (e.g. `src/index.ts`)
            - `line` must be the **last** line number of the changed hunk the comment applies to
            - If the comment spans multiple lines, also include `"start_line": <first line>` and `"start_side": "RIGHT"`
            - Post one comment per finding; do not batch multiple issues into a single comment

            ### Step 4 — Post a comment with additional findings
            After all inline comments are posted, add a top-level PR comment listing any findings that could not be mapped to a specific line:
            ```
            gh pr comment ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --body "<summary>"
            ```
